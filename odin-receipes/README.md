Odin Recipes
This project aims to create a simple recipe website where users can find and browse various recipes. The main goal is to demonstrate proficiency in HTML and web development skills.

Iteration 1: Index Page
Create an index.html file within the odin-recipes directory.
Fill it with the standard boilerplate HTML structure.
Add an <h1> heading with the content "Odin Recipes" to the body.
Iteration 2: Recipe Page
Create a recipes directory within the odin-recipes directory.
Inside the recipes directory, create an HTML file named after the recipe it will contain (e.g., lasagna.html).
Include an <h1> heading with the recipe's name as its content.
In the index.html file, add a link to the recipe page. For example:
php
Copy code
<a href="recipes/lasagna.html">Lasagna</a>
Iteration 3: Recipe Page Content
Your recipe page should have the following content:

An image of the finished dish.
A "Description" heading followed by a paragraph or two describing the recipe.
An "Ingredients" heading followed by an unordered list of the recipe's ingredients.
A "Steps" heading followed by an ordered list of the steps needed to make the dish.
Iteration 4: Add More Recipes
Add two more recipe pages with the same structure as the first recipe page.
Link to the new recipe pages on the index page. Consider using an unordered list to organize the links.
That's the basic structure and tasks involved in the project. You can expand and customize it further as per your requirements and creativity. Good luck with your project! If you have any specific questions or need further assistance, feel free to ask.
